## 🔧 **Troubleshooting**

### **Docker Build Issues**

If you encounter Docker build errors, try these solutions:

#### **Backend Build Errors (go.mod/go.sum issues)**
```bash
# Clean up Go modules and rebuild
cd backend
go mod tidy
go mod download
cd ..
docker-compose down
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d --build
```

#### **General Docker Issues**
```bash
# Clean rebuild everything
make clean
